A simple text-based sandbox game. It has five components:

1. Main: Responsible for the introduction sequence and the game loop

2. Display: Handles pretty printing of game messages

3. Parse: Reads the player input and either matches it with a game action or returns an appropriate error message

4. Creator: Used by Parse to create things in-game when the player interacts with them

5. Winsize: Gets the size of the console window. Used by Curses for appropriate window sizing and text placement
